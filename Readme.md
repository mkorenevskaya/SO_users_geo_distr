Geographical distribution for <java>-tagged posts
------
To obtain the final result, the following steps were performed.
1. The StackOverflow database was used to get the raw data containing IDs of the users who asked questions with tag <java> and their locations: [http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new). The used SQL code is provided at ```get_locations.sql``` file.
2. Raw data was saved to ```QueryResults.csv``` manually (from the StackOverflow query editor page). It was asked in the task to use 1k of relevant users, but the raw data contains 1100 users. This was done because some users indicated an incorrect location based on which it is impossible to determine the country. So, in order to obtain the geographical distribution of 1000 users it is necessary to get a bit more rows from the database.
3. The python script ```geographical_distribution.py``` was used to process the raw data. The modules ```Pandas```, ```Requests``` and ```Time``` were used.
4. The python script uses ```Google Maps Geocoding API``` to process the users locations and to determine the countries and their ISO-2 codes. This API allows only 2500 free requests per day. The API key is in the file ```api_key.txt```. If you are going to use the python script several times per day, please log in your Google account, go to [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) to get the new key and replace the key in ```api_key.txt``` with the new value. To determine the ISO-3 codes of the countries, a free dataset ```Free Data â€“ ISO Countries``` was used. I downloaded the ```Country.csv``` file from [http://kejser.org/resources/free-data/free-data-countries-world](http://kejser.org/resources/free-data/free-data-countries-world).
4. The resulting geographical distribution of users was generated by python script and saved to ```geographical_distribution.csv``` file: CSV, columns: Country, ISO-3, NumOfUsers, ```,``` as delimiter.
