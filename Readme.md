Geographical distribution for <java>-tagged posts
------
To obtain the final result, the following steps were performed.
1. The StackOverflow database was used to get the raw data containing IDs of the users who asked questions with tag <java> and their locations: [http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new). The used SQL code is provided at ```get_locations.sql``` file.
2. Raw data was saved to ```QueryResults.csv``` manually (from the StackOverflow query editor page).
3. The python script ```geographical_distribution.py``` was used to process the raw data. The modules ```Pandas```, ```Requests``` and ```Time``` were used.
4. The python script uses ```Google Maps Geocoding API``` to process the users locations and to determine the countries and their ISO-2 codes. This API allows only 2500 free requests per day. The API key is in the file ```api_key.txt```. If you are going to use the python script several times per day, please log in your Google account, go to [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) to get the new key and replace the key in ```api_key.txt``` with the new value. To determine the ISO-3 codes of the countries, a free dataset ```Free Data â€“ ISO Countries``` was used. I downloaded the ```Country.csv``` file from [http://kejser.org/resources/free-data/free-data-countries-world](http://kejser.org/resources/free-data/free-data-countries-world).
4. The resulting geographical distribution of users was generated by python script and saved to ```geographical_distribution.csv``` file: CSV, columns: Country, ISO-3, NumOfUsers, ```,``` as delimiter.
